## About

Faraday introduces a new concept - IPE (Integrated Penetration-Test Environment) a multiuser Penetration test IDE. Designed for distributing, indexing, and analyzing the data generated during a security audit.

> Made for true pentesters!

Faraday was made to let you take advantage of the available tools in the community in a truly multiuser way.

Faraday crunches the data you load into different visualizations that are useful to managers and pentesters alike.

![GUI - Web](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/dashboard/dashboard.png)

Designed for simplicity, users should notice no difference between their own terminal application and the one included in Faraday. Developed with a specialized set of functionalities, users improve their own work. Do you remember the last time you programmed without an IDE? What IDEs are to programming, Faraday is to pentesting.

![Supported Os](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/platform/supported.png)

To begin the installation process, check out our [Installation Wiki](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Install-Guide).

## Development

You need Python 3.6+ and postgres to run the faraday server.

If you want to develop for Faraday, please follow our [development setup for linux](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Development-setup) or [development setup for OSX](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Development-Installation-OSX).

## Quickstart

Once you installed faraday packages, you will need to initialize the faraday database:

```
sudo faraday-manage initdb
```

This will give you a *randomly generated password* to log into the web UI.
Now you can start the server with:

```
systemctl start faraday-server
```

In your browser, now you can go to localhost:5985 and login with "faraday" as username, and the password generated in the initdb step.


## New Features!

All of Faraday's latest features and updates are always available on our [blog](https://medium.com/faraday).
There are new entries every few weeks, don't forget to check out our amazing new improvements on its latest entry!

## API

This is a branch for a PoC of automatically generating the API documentation in the [OpenAPI/swagger](https://www.openapis.org/) format.
To generate the API docs, for example, to use with swagger UI, run:

```
faraday-manage openapi-yaml
```


## Plugins list

You feed data to Faraday from your favorite tools through Plugins. Right now there are more than [70+ supported tools](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Plugin-List), among which you will find:

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/plugins/Plugins.png)

There are three Plugin types: **console** plugins which intercept and interpret the output of the tools you execute, **report** plugins which allows you to import previously generated XMLs, and **online** plugins which access Faraday's API or allow Faraday to connect to external APIs and databases.

[Read more about Plugins](http://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Plugin-List).

Faraday plugins code can be found in [faraday-plugin repository](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_plugins)

## Features

### Workspaces

Information is organized into various **Workspaces**. Each Workspace contains a pentest team's assignments and all the intel that is discovered.

### Agents

[Faraday Agents Dispatcher](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_agent_dispatcher) helps user develop integrations with Faraday written in any language.
Agents collects information from different network location using different tools. You can use [FaradaySEC](https://www.faradaysec.com) to orchestrate tool execution.

### Conflicts

If two plugins produce clashing information for an individual element, a conflict that the user will have to resolve is generated.  An example is if **user1** incorporates host *127.0.0.1 OS:Linux* and **user2** incorporates *127.0.0.1 OS: Linux Ubuntu 13.10*.

On our [GTK interface](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Usage#gtk-gui) there's a button on the bottom right corner of the main window displaying the number of conflicts in the current workspace. To resolve them, just click on the button and a window will open where you can edit the conflicting objects and select which one to keep.

### Faraday plugin

Using our plugin you can perform various actions using the command line, for example:

    $ cd faraday-dev/bin/
    $ ./fplugin create_host 192.154.33.222 Android
    1a7b2981c7becbcb3d5318056eb29a58817f5e67
    $ ./fplugin filter_services http ssh -p 21 -a
    Filtering services for ports: 21, 22, 80, 443, 8080, 8443

    192.168.20.1    ssh     [22]    tcp open    None
    192.168.20.1    http    [443]   tcp open    None
    192.168.20.7    ssh     [22]    tcp open    Linux
    192.168.20.7    http    [443]   tcp open    Linux
    192.168.20.11   ssh     [22]    tcp open    Linux
