## About

Faraday introduces a new concept - IPE (Integrated Penetration-Test Environment) a multiuser Penetration test IDE. Designed for distributing, indexing, and analyzing the data generated during a security audit.

> Made for true pentesters!

Faraday was made to let you take advantage of the available tools in the community in a truly multiuser way.

Designed for simplicity, users should notice no difference between their own terminal application and the one included in Faraday. Developed with a specialized set of functionalities, users improve their own work. Do you remember the last time you programmed without an IDE? What IDEs are to programming, Faraday is to pentesting.

Faraday crunches the data you load into different visualizations that are useful to managers and pentesters alike.

There are three Plugin types: **console** plugins which intercept and interpret the output of the tools you execute, **report** plugins which allows you to import previously generated XMLs, and **online** plugins which access Faraday's API or allow Faraday to connect to external APIs and databases.

[Read more about Plugins](http://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Plugin-List).

## Features

### Workspaces
Information is organized into various **Workspaces**. Each Workspace contains a pentest team's assignments and all the intel that is discovered.

### Conflicts
If two plugins produce clashing information for an individual element, a conflict that the user will have to resolve is generated.  An example is if **user1** incorporates host *127.0.0.1 OS:Linux* and **user2** incorporates *127.0.0.1 OS: Linux Ubuntu 13.10*.

On our [GTK interface](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Usage#gtk-gui) there's a button on the bottom right corner of the main window displaying the number of conflicts in the current workspace. To resolve them, just click on the button and a window will open where you can edit the conflicting objects and select which one to keep.

### Faraday plugin

Using our plugin you can perform various actions using the command line, for example:

    $ cd faraday-dev/bin/
    $ ./fplugin create_host 192.154.33.222 Android
    1a7b2981c7becbcb3d5318056eb29a58817f5e67
    $ ./fplugin filter_services http ssh -p 21 -a
    Filtering services for ports: 21, 22, 80, 443, 8080, 8443

    192.168.20.1    ssh     [22]    tcp open    None
    192.168.20.1    http    [443]   tcp open    None
    192.168.20.7    ssh     [22]    tcp open    Linux
    192.168.20.7    http    [443]   tcp open    Linux
