We are proud to present two new features that will enhace the Faraday experience.
Taking feedback from our users we took account that each of them had particular needs from their consoles (completion, size, fonts, so on so forth)  and their need to be able to know what commands where run during an engagement.

    * A brand new ZSH based Terminal UI
    * The Command Run execution history
