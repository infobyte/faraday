* Reservation of Rights. Infobyte LLC. reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA. 

3. FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS. Customer shall pay Infobyte LLC the fees, charges and other amounts specified on the Product Order Form in accordance with the payment terms set forth on the Product Order Form.

In the event Customer is required to withhold taxes from its payment to Infobyte LLC or withholding taxes are subsequently required to be paid to a local taxing jurisdiction, Customer is obligated to pay such tax, and Infobyte LLC will receive the full payment, net of any such taxes, as agreed on the applicable
Product Order Form. Customer shall also pay all reasonable travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Infobyte LLC in connection with any Services

9.  LIMITED WARRANTY FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. Infobyte LLC. warrants that the Product will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying materials for a period of ninety days from the date of receipt. If an implied warranty or condition is created by your state/jurisdiction and federal or state/provincial law prohibits disclaimer of it, you also have an implied warranty or condition, BUT ONLY AS TO DEFECTS DISCOVERED DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY (THIRTY DAYS). AS TO ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED AFTER THE THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty or condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you. Any supplements or updates to the Product, including without limitation, any (if any) service packs or hot fixes provided to you after the expiration of the ninety day Limited Warranty period are not covered by any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory. LIMITATION ON REMEDIES; NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES. Your exclusive remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty is as set forth below. Except for any refund elected by Infobyte LLC., YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if the Product does not meet Infobyte LLC.'s Limited Warranty, and, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose. The terms of Section 13 below ("Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages") are also incorporated into this Limited Warranty. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. This Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others which vary from state/jurisdiction to state/jurisdiction. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Infobyte LLC.'s and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at Infobyte LLC.'s option from time to time exercised subject to applicable law, (a) return of the price paid (if any) for the Product, or (b) repair or replacement of the Product, that does not meet this Limited Warranty and that is returned to Infobyte LLC. with a copy of your receipt. You will receive the remedy elected by Infobyte LLC. without charge, except that you are responsible for any expenses you may incur (e.g. cost of shipping the Product to Infobyte LLC.). This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Product has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, abnormal use or a virus. Any replacement Product will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. Outside the United States or Canada, neither these remedies nor any product support services offered by Infobyte LLC. are available without proof of purchase from an authorized international source.
