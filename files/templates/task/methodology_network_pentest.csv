"1. Network Footprinting", "The tester would attempt to gather as much information as possible about the selected network. This would usually involve trying to discover publicly available information by utilising a web browser, DNS zone transfer or a social engineering type of attack."
"2. Discovery & Probing", "Enumeration can serve two distinct purposes in an assessment: OS fingerprinting or TCP/IP stack fingerprinting and fingerprinting services and remote applications. There are two main ways to do OS fingerprinting: actively (i.e. nmap) or passively (i.e. scanrand). By port scanning it is then possible to build up a picture of which services and applications are running and tailor the tests accordingly."
"3. Enumeration", "Check common services like FTP, SSH, SMTP, TELNET, HTTP, MySQL, PPTP, etc. Attempt to enumerate valid users to identify potential victims and attack vectors."
"4. Password cracking", "Use tools like Rainbow crack, ophcrack, John the Ripper, pwdump, etc. in order to be able to break passwords and gain access to the system."
"5. Vulnerability Assessment", "Utilising vulnerability scanners all discovered hosts can be tested for vulnerabilities. The result would then be analysed to determine if there are any vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain access to a target host on a network."
"6. Network Backbone", "Always check the network traffic. Use tools like Wireshark, Cain & Abel, Yersinia, etc. and try to get more access to be able to scale and propagate in the network."
"7. Penetration & Exploit", "An exploit usually relates to the existence of some flaw or vulnerability in an application or operating system that if used could lead to privilege escalation or denial of service against the computer system that is being attacked."
"8. Wireless Penetration", "Wireless Assessment. The following information should ideally be obtained/enumerated when carrying out your wireless assessment - cypher type (WEP, WPA, etc), VLANs, channels, traffic, etc."
"9. Physical Security", "Review how perimeter security works. Check for active network jacks, printers, phones and any information in the room. Note what type of locks are used in building, pin tumblers, padlocks, cabinet locks, dimple keys, proximity sensors and do some lock picking attack."
