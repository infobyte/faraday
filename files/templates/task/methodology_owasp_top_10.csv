"A1 Injection", "Enforce input field type and lengths. Validate fields and provide feedback. Ensure option selects and radio contain only sent values."
"A2 Weak authentication and session management", "Validate user is authenticated and if the role is sufficient for this view. Check Set 'secure' and 'HttpOnly' flags for session cookies and always review if forms send CSRF token."
"A3 XSS", "Set correct content type. Set safe character set (UTF-8) and set correct locale. Output encode all user data as per output context. Set input constraints and remember that On Submit enforce input field type and lengths."
"A4 Insecure Direct Object References", "If data is from internal trusted sources, validate that no data is sent. Send indirect random access reference map value and provide feedback."
"A5 Security Misconfiguration", "Ensure web servers and application servers are hardened. For example in PHP: Ensure allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include are both disabled in php.ini."
"A6 Sensitive Data Exposure", "Validate strong ciphers (AES 128 or better) with secure mode of operations (do not use ECB). Use strong hashes (SHA 256 or better) with salts for passwords and protect keys more than any other asset. Use TLS 1.2 or later for all web communications. Some people send keys or hashes to the browser, never do that."
"A7 Missing Function Level Access Control", "Ensure all non-web data is outside the web root (logs, configuration, etc). Use octet byte streaming instead of providing access to real files such as PDFs or CSVs or similar. Ensure every page requires a role and user is authenticated, even if it is 'guest'."
"A8 Cross Site Request Forgery", "Validate user is authenticated and role is sufficient for this view. Send CSRF token."
"A9 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities", "Applications may use various third-party libraries/components that can be outdated and contain vulnerabilities with public exploits. Those are a great vector for starting an attack. You can run OWASP dependency check for the components."
"A10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards", "Design the app without URL redirection parameters and use random indirect object references for redirection parameters."
